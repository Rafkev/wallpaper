Implementation of a wallpaper app using Flutter and the Unsplash API
Creating a wallpaper application involves fetching wallpapers from an API and displaying them in a user-friendly interface. Here's a simple implementation of a wallpaper app using Flutter and the Unsplash API, which provides high-quality images:

You will need to do the following
1.) First, add the necessary dependencies to your pubspec.yaml file
2.) Create a new Dart file, for example, wallpaper_app.dart, and implement the wallpaper application
3.) Replace 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY' with your Unsplash API key.
